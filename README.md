# 🎵 Classic Winamp — A Theme for EmulationStation

This is a custom theme for **EmulationStation**, inspired by the look and feel of **classic Winamp**. It’s a small tribute to those late 90s / early 2000s days — back when customizing your MP3 player skin felt like a form of self-expression.

I built this mainly for **ArkOS**, with a strong focus on **4:3 handheld devices** like the **R36S** and **BatleXP G350** (tested on both). It’s lightweight, pixel-friendly, and designed to feel a bit like booting up Winamp all over again — just with ROMs instead of MP3s.

## 🎛 Theme Configuration Options

In EmulationStation, head to:

**UI Settings > Theme Configuration**

From there, you can fine-tune how things display:

- **Video Preview Options**:  
  Choose whether the video view shows a **screenshot**, **marquee**, or **thumbnail** as your game's preview snapshot.

- **Gamelist Options**:  
  Decide what appears below the main image in detail view:  
  - A **description**  
  - A **marquee**  
  - Or **nothing** at all for a cleaner look

These options are there to help you tailor the layout to your taste or device.

This project wouldn't exist without that work.
